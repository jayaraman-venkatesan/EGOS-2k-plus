Exercise 5:

Q: After uncommenting the line in apps/user/crash3.c,
   what do you see when running `crash3 proc` in egos?
   And why?
   (Explain in fewer than 3 sentences)

A: 
OUTPUT :
âžœ /home/cs6640 crash3 proc
[SUCCESS] Crash3 succeeds in corrupting the memory of other processes
[FATAL] fatal exception (pid=1) 2

REASON :
The second memset modified the DTIM free memory start which is being used in mmu_switch() to temprorily store while 
doing kernel switch. As instructions and data are 1s and 0s (from lab1) it modifies the code gives exception 2 (ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION)





Q2: Can you prevent `crash3 proc` using PMP?
    Why and why not?
   (Explain in fewer than 3 sentences)

A: // write your answers here
We cannot stop it
REASON : 
The crash proc is modifying the DTIM Free mem space in first memset and we cannot set it to read only as 
we need process to use them for multiple purposes as it is needed during mmu_switch

Student Name : Jingyi Mao
Reason : 
"He was struck on interpreting the following line in lab"
"inode numbers and index in inode array (block 2â€“11). Given an inode number X (for example, 101), the inode can be located by X-100 (1) in the inode array."

Just told him block_size = 512 and inode_size = 64 so there is no 1-1 mapping of blocks and inode but one block has lot of inodes
